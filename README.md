 Predict the carbon dioxide working capacity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
 We used a neural network to create this model. Because of many experiments, I think the neural network is the most suitable for our information and meets our needs. Our team's biggest problem was that the surface area could not be valued, requiring a lot of data editing. Before being able to train, a lot of overfitting followed in the end, from the team's decision to help solve the above problems. The result is something we're proud of and think we can at least get our model with 80 percent accuracy, even with quite a lot of missing data (where we can't generate more from the dataset. that we have).
Another important thing is overcoming ourselves by not giving up (stubborn that will continue to train the model). Our group together to create this piece. It made us learn many things. Especially as we realize that ultimately, in the future, machine learning will use in all fields, we will focus on further study in this area and research around us to see where we can use machine learning to be helpful.
